# Searching

### Basic Searching in Vim
While in normal mode, you can hit `/` then type in your search pattern and then press `Enter` to perform the search.
- `/pattern` to search forward for the pattern
- `?pattern` to search backward for the pattern
- `ESC` to exit out of the search
- `n` to repeat forward search
- `N` to repeat backward search

### Search History
Vim has a search history. You can type `/` or `?`, or also use the arrow up or arrow down keys to view previous searches.
